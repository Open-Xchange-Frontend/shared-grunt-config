# Shared Open-Xchange Appsuite UI module grunt configuration

This shared configuration can be used to develop modules for the Open-Xchange Appsuite UI.
It has been part of the [generator-ox-ui-module](Open-Xchange-Frondend/generator-ox-ui-module) project, that can
help you getting started building own modules using [yo](http://yeoman.io/), but has
been extracted to be released on its own.
